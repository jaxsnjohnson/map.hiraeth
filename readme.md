# Hiraeth Interactive World Map Viewer

An interactive map viewer for the world of Hiraeth, built with Leaflet.js.

**[Live Demo](https://maps.hiraeth.wiki)**

## About The Project

This project is an interactive map viewer designed to display custom world maps, specifically for the world of Hiraeth. It allows users to explore different regions, view points of interest (POIs), and interact with map features.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and Leaflet.js, this tool provides a dynamic way to navigate and visualize the various locations within the Hiraeth setting. It loads map configurations and points of interest from JSON data files, offering features like zooming, panning, marker popups, region overlays, filtering, and searching.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser, Node.js 22 or newer, and a local web server. ImageMagick with WebP support is required to build the production map tiles. On macOS, install the image tools with `brew install imagemagick webp`.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hiraeth-Adventuring-Information-Repos/map.hiraeth.git
   cd map.hiraeth
   ```
2. Install dependencies and build the production bundle:
   ```sh
   npm ci
   npm run build:pages
   ```
3. Serve the generated bundle. For example, using Python:
   ```sh
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
   ```
   Or with Node.js:
   ```sh
   npx http-server dist -p 8000
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Validation And Deployment

Install dependencies and run the complete local release check:

```sh
npm ci
npm run publish:check
```

The publish check regenerates the atlas index, validates map data, runs the unit suite, and builds the optimized GitHub Pages artifact in `dist/`. The Pages build minifies owned JS/CSS, compacts JSON, and moves cross-map search data into a lazy payload while preserving native-resolution map tiles. Generated tiles are reused from `.cache/pages-tiles` and only stale map fingerprints are rebuilt. Both directories are generated and ignored by Git; do not commit them.

Pushes to `main` are deployed by `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml`. The workflow restores map tiles by source fingerprint, regenerates only changed maps, uploads `dist/` as the Pages artifact, and deploys it through GitHub Actions. The repository's Pages source must be set to **GitHub Actions** rather than branch publishing.

When changing browser-delivered JavaScript, CSS, map data, or tiles, bump `assets.version` in `site.config.json` and the matching default version in `js/app-config.js` so versioned URLs and service-worker caches advance together.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack

*   **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the structure and styling of the web pages.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers the application logic, including data loading, UI interactions, and Leaflet.js integration.
*   **[Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)**: A lightweight, open-source library for interactive maps. It was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and ease of use with custom map tiles and overlays.

### Data Format

The map data is stored in JSON files within the `maps/` directory.

*   **`maps/maps.json`**: This file is the flat authoring manifest for map order and hierarchy. Each entry describes one map or folder, and relationships are expressed with `parentId`, `order`, and `dataUrl` instead of nested child objects.
*   **`maps/atlas-index.json`**: This generated file is the runtime atlas manifest. The app boots from it, builds atlas search from it, and uses its `dataUrl` entries to lazy-load full map definitions.
*   **`<map_id>.json`**: Each map has its own JSON file containing its metadata:
    *   `id`, `name`, `width`, `height`, `imageUrl`
    *   `scalePixels`, `scaleKilometers`: For the measurement tool.
    *   `blurb`: A short HTML description displayed on the map.
    *   `pointsOfInterest`: An array of POI objects (`coords`, `name`, `type`, `description`, `wikiLink`, optional `linkedMapId`).
    *   `regions`: An array of region objects (`id`, `name`, `description`, `type`, `color`, `fillColor`, `fillOpacity`, `wikiLink`, `coordinates`, optional `linkedMapId`).

## Features

*   **Interactive Map Display**: Smooth zooming and panning with Leaflet.js.
*   **Dynamic Data Loading**: The app boots from a generated atlas index, then lazy-loads each full map JSON on demand.
*   **Atlas Navigation**: A dedicated collapsible Atlas for browsing maps and hierarchy.
*   **Feature Details**: Compact map popups open a larger desktop sheet or mobile full-screen detail view.
*   **Markers & Regions**: Toggleable markers for POIs and colored polygon regions.
*   **Filtering & Search**: Filter POIs and regions by type, and search for POIs by name.
*   **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes.
*   **Measurement Tool**: Measure distances on the map.
*   **Ambient Sounds**: Background sounds that change with the theme.
*   **Embeddable View**: UI can be hidden for embedding in other websites.
